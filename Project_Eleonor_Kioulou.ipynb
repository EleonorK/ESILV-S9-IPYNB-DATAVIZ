    "Social media is very important in our lives, especially for university students. This project looks at how using social media affects the mental health of young adults. We use survey data from Kaggle to understand the link between social media and problems like depression and anxiety. We will make interactive charts with tools like Bokeh or Plotly to explain our findings. This study is useful for students, teachers, and health experts. It's important now because mental health is getting more attention in schools and the tech world. We want to help people understand how social media can affect our mental health."

The distribution is relatively even among those who spend less than an hour, those who spend between 1 and 2 hours, and those who spend between 3 and 4 hours per day on social media. Users who spend less than 1 hour represent a slightly smaller proportion, suggesting that the majority of users engage with social media for an extended period, which can be considered excessive."

It indicates that social media users generally report higher levels of difficulty with concentration, distraction while busy, purposeless use, sleep issues, and restlessness compared to non-users, highlighting a potential adverse impact of social media usage on these aspects of mental health."

    "1. Feelings About Comparison: As people's feelings about comparison increase, there doesn't seem to be a clear trend in how it relates to feeling depressed. The spread of responses is fairly consistent across all levels.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Sleep Issues: There's a noticeable trend that as sleep issues worsen (moving from 1 to 5), the median level of feeling depressed increases, suggesting a possible correlation where poor sleep might be associated with higher levels of depression.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Bothered by Worries: Similarly to sleep issues, as the level of being bothered by worries increases, so does the median level of feeling depressed. This could indicate that being more worried is associated with higher depression.\n",

    "4. Validation Seeking: The spread and median levels appear to increase with the level of validation seeking, hinting that those who seek more validation might also experience higher levels of depression."

Platforms like TikTok and Snapchat exhibit slightly higher median depression levels, whereas Facebook and Twitter are on the lower end. The variability in depression levels is also platform-dependent, with some showing a wider range of responses. Despite these nuances, the overall trend indicates a general consistency in reported depression levels across different platforms."

Heavy use of social media and tendencies to compare with others are associated with higher self-reported depression. Those not engaged in social media tend to report lower depression levels. The data implies that while social media use is a significant factor in mental health, the impact may vary depending on how individuals engage with these platforms.\n",
